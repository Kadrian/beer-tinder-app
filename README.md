# beer-tinder-app
Lets Markus evaluate beers in tinder style <br/>
Soon deployed at www.markus-trinkt.de <br/>
www.markus-trinkt.de/statistics shows how often he has voted in favor or against a beer!

# Setup
bundle install <br/>
bundle exec ruby beer-tinder-app.rb

## With automatic reload
gem install rerun
rerun 'beer-tinder-app.rb'

# TODO
1.) Save the current beer index so Markus doesn't have to start evaluating from the beginning every time he clicks statistics.<br/>
2.) Insert Beer pics</br>
3.) Make statistics look even more fancy<br/>
